# Steering Tracker

Steering Tracker is a computer program written in C++ using OpenCV library for applying Object Tracking using Computer Vision to computer games. The games(example: Car racing games) can be controlled without any keyboard or mouse controls. A game specific physical controller with multiple markers can be designed and used with this program to control games easily. This provides a more immersive platform to the players and also relieves them from the trouble of cords and faulty controllers.

## Usage
The program can be built using `g++` compiler along with OpenCV libraries.
